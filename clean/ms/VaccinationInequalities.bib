  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Significant differences in COVID-19 incidence by gender, class and race/ethnicity are recorded in many countries in the world. Lockdown measures, shown to be effective in reducing the number of new cases, may not have been effective in the same way for all, failing to protect the most vulnerable populations. This survey aims to assess social inequalities in the trends in COVID-19 infections following lockdown.                                         Methods               A cross-sectional survey conducted among the general population in France in April 2020, during COVID-19 lockdown.               Ten thousand one hundred one participants aged 18\textendash 64, from a national cohort who lived in the three metropolitan French regions most affected by the first wave of COVID-19.               The main outcome was occurrence of possible COVID-19 symptoms, defined as the occurrence of sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted more than 3 days in the 15\,days before the survey. We used multinomial regression models to identify social and health factors related to possible COVID-19 before and during the lockdown.                                         Results                                In all, 1304 (13.0\%; 95\% CI: 12.0\textendash 14.0\%) reported cases of possible COVID-19. The effect of lockdown on the occurrence of possible COVID-19 was different across social hierarchies. The most privileged class individuals saw a significant decline in possible COVID-19 infections between the period prior to lockdown and during the lockdown (from 8.8 to 4.3\%,                 P                 ~=\,0.0001) while the decline was less pronounced among working class individuals (6.9\% before lockdown and 5.5\% during lockdown,                 P                 ~=\,0.03). This differential effect of lockdown remained significant after adjusting for other factors including history of chronic disease. The odds of being infected during lockdown as opposed to the prior period increased by 57\% among working class individuals (OR\,=\,1.57; 95\% CI: 1.00\textendash 2.48). The same was true for those engaged in in-person professional activities during lockdown (OR\,=\,1.53; 95\% CI: 1.03\textendash 2.29).                                                        Conclusions               Lockdown was associated with social inequalities in the decline in COVID-19 infections, calling for the adoption of preventive policies to account for living and working conditions. Such adoptions are critical to reduce social inequalities related to COVID-19, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess whether  mistrust in the government and scientists reinforces social and racial inequalities in vaccination practises  Design A follow-up of a random population-based cohort survey. Setting In July 2021, in France. Participants 80,971 participants aged 18 years and more. Main outcome measures Adjusted odds ratios of Covid-19 vaccination status (received at least one dose/ intends to get vaccinated/ does not know whether to get vaccinated/refuses vaccination) were assessed using multinomial regressions to test  associations with social and mistrust factors and to study how these two factors interacted with each other. Results In all, 72.2\% were vaccinated at the time of the survey. The population of unvaccinated people was younger, less educated, had lower incomes, and more often belonged to racialised minorities, as compared to vaccinated people. Mistrust of government and scientists to curb the spread of the epidemic were the factors most associated with refusing to be vaccinated: OR=8.86 (7.13 to 11.00) for the government and OR=9.07 (7.71 to 10.07) for scientists, compared to vaccinated people. Mistrust was more prevalent among the poorer which consequently reinforced social inequalities in vaccination. The 10\% poorest who did not trust the government  reached an OR of 16.2 (11.9 to 22) for  refusing to be vaccinated compared to the 10\% richest who did. Conclusion There is a need to develop depoliticised outreach programmes targeted at the most socially disadvantaged groups, and to design vaccination strategies conceived with people from different social and racial backgrounds to enable them to make fully informed choices.},

It then examines how these inequalities in COVID-19 are related to existing inequalities in chronic diseases and the social determinants of health, arguing that we are experiencing a syndemic pandemic It then explores the potential consequences for health inequalities of the lockdown measures implemented internationally as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the likely unequal impacts of the economic crisis. The essay concludes by reflecting on the longer-term public health policy responses needed to ensure that the COVID-19 pandemic does not increase health inequalities for future generations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior research has highlighted racial and ethnic disparities in H1N1 vaccination in the United States. Our study adds to this literature by utilizing an intersectionality framework to examine the joint influence of race and sex on H1N1 vaccination beliefs and behaviors among non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites (hereafter blacks and whites). METHODS: Using data from the National H1N1 Flu Survey of U.S. adults, we measured differences in beliefs about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine among black women, black men, white women, and white men. We then estimated a series of nested logistic regression models to examine how race/sex vaccination disparities were influenced by health beliefs, socioeconomic status (SES), pre-existing conditions, and healthcare. RESULTS: Black respondents were more likely than white respondents to express reservations about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine. Consistent with those beliefs, white females reported the highest rate of H1N1 vaccination (28.4\%), followed by white males (26.3\%), black males (21.6\%), and black females (17.5\%). Differences in health beliefs, SES, pre-existing conditions, and healthcare explained lower odds of H1N1 vaccination among white men and black men, relative to white women. However, black women experienced 35-45\% lower odds of vaccination than white women across all models, highlighting the intersectional nature of these associations. DISCUSSION: The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a cautionary tale about the distribution of new vaccines across large populations with diverse racial, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics. Despite differences between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics, our study warns that many black Americans will forego COVID-19 vaccines unless swift action is taken to address black-white disparities in access to vital resources. Public health stakeholders can also encourage widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines by tailoring health promotion messages for different groups of racial minorities, especially groups like black women who face intersecting disadvantages.},

Realising these benefits will depend in part upon the behavioural and social impacts of certification. The aim of this rapid review was to describe public attitudes towards certification, and its possible impact on uptake of testing and vaccination, protective behaviours, and crime.                                         Method               A search was undertaken in peer-reviewed databases, pre-print databases, and the grey literature, from 2000 to December 2020. Studies were included if they measured attitudes towards or behavioural consequences of health certificates based on one of three indices of Covid-19 status: test-negative result for current infectiousness, test-positive for antibodies conferring natural immunity, or vaccination(s) conferring immunity.                                         Results               Thirty-three papers met the inclusion criteria, only three of which were rated as low risk of bias. Public attitudes were generally favourable towards the use of immunity certificates for international travel, but unfavourable towards their use for access to work and other activities. A significant minority was strongly opposed to the use of certificates of immunity for any purpose. The limited evidence suggested that intention to get vaccinated varied with the activity enabled by certification or vaccination (e.g., international travel). Where vaccination is seen as compulsory this could lead to unwillingness to accept a subsequent vaccination. There was some evidence that restricting access to settings and activities to those with antibody test certificates may lead to deliberate exposure to infection in a minority. Behaviours that reduce transmission may decrease upon health certificates based on any of the three indices of Covid-19 status, including physical distancing and handwashing.                                         Conclusions               The limited evidence suggests that health certification in relation to COVID-19 \textendash{} outside of the context of international travel \textendash{} has the potential for harm as well as benefit. Realising the benefits while minimising the harms will require real-time evaluations allowing modifications to maximise the potential contribution of certification to enable safer access to a range of activities.},

Public actions and omissions severely affect the poor, alongside their precarious living, health and working conditions. As we slowly prepare for the aftermath of the pandemic, thanks to the progression of vaccination, especially in developed countries, certain measures taken in this context, more specifically the ``vaccination certificates'', are likely particularly to affect the poor, who usually also belong to other vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities or single parents, and could eventually constitute for them a state of permanent quarantine. In this contribution, I argue that COVID-19 vaccination certificates are a slippery slope towards exclusion and stigmatisation of the poor through a bureaucratic system based on privileges that raises important questions in light of the fundamental rights of the people who reside at society's margins, struggling to conform to the ``phantom of normalcy''.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        Importance             Discovery of effective vaccines and increased confidence that infection confers extended protection against COVID-19 have renewed discussion of using immunity certificates or ``passports'' to selectively reduce ongoing public health restrictions.                                   Objective             To determine public views regarding government and private conferral of immunity privileges.                                   Design and Setting             National on-line survey fielded in June 2020. Participants were randomly asked about either government ``passports'' or private ``certificates'' for COVID-19 immunity.                                   Participants             Adults from a standing panel maintained for academic research, selected to approximate national demographics.                                   Main Outcomes/Measures             Level of support/opposition to immunity privileges, and whether views vary based on: government vs. private adoption; demographics; political affiliation or views; or various COVID19-related attitudes and experiences.                                   Results             Of 1315 respondents, 45.2\% supported immunity privileges, with slightly more favoring private certificates than government passports (48.1\% vs 42.6\%, p=0.04). Support was greater for using passports or certificates to enable returns to high-risk jobs or attendance at large recreational events than for returning to work generally. Levels of support did not vary significantly according to age groups, socioeconomic or employment status, urbanicity, political affiliation or views, or whether the respondent had chronic disease(s). However, estimates from adjusted analyses showed less support among women (Odds Ratio, 0.64; 95\% Confidence Interval, 0.51 to 0.80), and among Hispanics (0.56; 0.40 to 0.78) and other minorities (0.58; 0.40 to 0.85) compared with whites, but not among blacks (0.83; 0.60 to 1.15). Support was much higher among those who personally wanted a passport or certificate (75.6\% vs 24.4\%) and much lower among those who believed this would harm the social fabric of their community (22.9\% vs 77.1\%).                                   Conclusions and Relevance             Public views are divided on either government or private use of immunity certificates, but, prior to any efforts to politicize the issues, these views do not vary along usual political lines, nor by characteristics that indicate individual vulnerability to infection. Social consensus on the desirability of an immunity privileges programs may be difficult to achieve.                                   Key Points                            Question               What are the public's views on government or private use of immunity ``passports'' to selectively lift COVID-19 restrictions?                                         Findings               Views are divided and do not vary substantially according to political affiliation or many demographic factors. Support is greater among men but lower among Hispanics and those who believe that immunity privileges would harm the social fabric of society.                                         Meaning               Social consensus will be difficult to achieve on the appropriateness of immunity privileges.},

In this study, we analysed a broad range of socioeconomic indicators in relation to hospitalised cases in the Paris area.                                         Methods               We extracted 303 socioeconomic indicators from French census data for 855 residential units in Paris and assessed their association with COVID-19 hospitalisation risk.                                         Findings               The indicators most associated with hospitalisation risk were the third decile of population income (OR=9.10, 95\%\,CI 4.98 to 18.39), followed by the primary residence rate (OR=5.87, 95\%\,CI 3.46 to 10.61), rate of active workers in unskilled occupations (OR=5.04, 95\%\,CI 3.03 to 8.85) and rate of women over 15 years old with no diploma (OR=5.04, 95\%\,CI 3.03 to 8.85). Of note, population demographics were considerably less associated with hospitalisation risk. Among these indicators, the rate of women aged between 45 and 59 years (OR=2.17, 95\%\,CI 1.40 to 3.44) exhibited the greatest level of association, whereas population density was not associated. Overall, 86\% of COVID-19 hospitalised cases occurred within the 45\% most deprived areas.                                         Interpretation               Studying a broad range of socioeconomic indicators using census data and hospitalisation data as a readily available and large resource can provide real-time indirect information on populations with a high incidence of COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Objectives               The management of the COVID-19 pandemic hinges on the approval of safe and effective vaccines but, equally importantly, on high vaccine acceptance among people. To facilitate vaccine acceptance via effective health communication, it is key to understand levels of vaccine scepticism and the demographic, psychological and political predictors. To this end, we examine the levels and predictors of acceptance of an approved COVID-19 vaccine.                                         Design, setting and participants               We examine the levels and predictors of acceptance of an approved COVID-19 vaccine in large online surveys from eight Western democracies that differ in terms of the severity of the pandemic and their response: Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Italy, UK and USA (total N=18\,231). Survey respondents were quota sampled to match the population margins on age, gender and geographical location for each country. The study was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, allowing us to assess changes in acceptance and predictors as COVID-19 vaccine programmes were rolled out.                                         Outcome measure               The outcome of the study is self-reported acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine approved and recommended by health authorities.                                         Results               The data reveal large variations in vaccine acceptance that ranges from 83\% in Denmark to 47\% in France and Hungary. Lack of vaccine acceptance is associated with lack of trust in authorities and scientists, conspiratorial thinking and a lack of concern about COVID-19.                                         Conclusion               Most national levels of vaccine acceptance fall below estimates of the required threshold for herd immunity. The results emphasise the long-term importance of building trust in preparations for health emergencies such as the current pandemic. For health communication, the results emphasise the importance of focusing on personal consequences of infections and debunking of myths to guide communication strategies.},

In this paper, we demonstrate how this phenomenon constitutes various forms of theatre \textendash{} immunity theatre, border theatre, behavioural theatre and equality theatre \textendash{} doing so by drawing on perspectives from technology regulation, migration studies and critical geopolitics. Technological theatre and political theatre often serve valid functions, but these forms are problematic for several reasons. First, they involve real-world infrastructures that, while unlikely to accomplish the task at hand, will nevertheless last a long time and be repurposed. They therefore constitute governance by data infrastructure, diverting action and control away from elected legislators to for-profit contractors. Second, vaccine certification effectively legitimises inequalities between countries and people by formalising ways to distinguish between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated and to exclude the latter, thus reinforcing both mobility and connectivity divides. It serves as a way to (further) close borders and to regulate, through code and infrastructure, access to public goods such as employment and public space. Finally, the project of certification displaces a more important action, namely addressing the radical inequality in countries' ability to combat the pandemic.},

To estimate this effect,                          we construct counterfactuals based on innovation diffusion theory             6             for France, Germany, and Italy. We estimate that the announcement of COVID certificates during summer 2021 led to increased vaccine uptake in France of 13.0 (95\% CI 9.7\textendash 14.9) percentage points (p.p.) of the total population up to the end of the year, in Germany 6.2 (2.6\textendash 6.9) p.p., and in Italy 9.7 (5.4\textendash 12.3) p.p. Further, this averted an additional 3,979 (3,453\textendash 4,298) deaths in France, 1,133 (-312\textendash 1,358) in Germany, and 1,331 (502\textendash 1,794) in Italy; and prevented gross domestic product (GDP) losses of \texteuro 6.0 (5.9\textendash 6.1) billion in France, \texteuro 1.4 (1.3\textendash 1.5) billion in Germany, and \texteuro 2.1 (2.0\textendash 2.2) billion in Italy. Notably, the application of COVID certificates substantially reduced the pressure on intensive care units (ICUs) and, in France, averted occupancy levels being exceeded where prior lockdowns were instated. Varying government communication efforts and restrictions associated with COVID certificates may explain country differences, such as the smaller effect in Germany. Overall, our findings are more sizeable than predicted.             7             This analysis may help inform decisions about when and how to employ COVID certificates to increase vaccine uptake and thus avoid stringent interventions, such as closures, curfews, and lockdowns, with major social and economic consequences.},

Across two countries and 1358 participants, we found that need frustration\textemdash particularly autonomy frustration\textemdash was associated with lower willingness to get vaccinated and with a shift from self-determined to external motivation. In Israel (a country with vaccine passports), people reported greater autonomy frustration than in the UK (a country without vaccine passports). Our findings suggest that control measures, such as domestic vaccine passports, may have detrimental effects on people's autonomy, motivation, and willingness to get vaccinated. Policies should strive to achieve a highly vaccinated population by supporting individuals' autonomous motivation to get vaccinated and using messages of autonomy and relatedness, rather than applying pressure and external controls.},

  abstract = {Abstract           In recent decades, France has appeared as a country particularly hostile to vaccination in general. When asked in November 2020 about the intention to take the Covid-19 vaccine, the French public showed, once again, reluctance. Therefore, France appeared as an ideal case study to analyze whether the hostility toward the Covid-19 vaccine has its own reasons or whether it is related to the reluctance to the principle of vaccination itself. Our objective was to determine the specificity of the social determinants of the intention to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Thanks to the use of a large random sample of the general population in France (86,000 individuals), the reluctant to Covid-19 vaccine could be clearly distinguished from the hesitant and the convinced, and thereby thoroughly analyzed. Our analysis highlighted a gendered reluctance toward vaccination in general but even more so regarding vaccination against Covid-19. It might refer to women being more concerned about the possible effects of an injection in their body, especially at the age of maternity and a differentiated socialization making them more sensitive than men to long-term risks and more apprehensive toward rapid technological change. We also found that people at the bottom of the social hierarchy, in terms of level of education, financial resources, and immigration status, were more likely to refuse the Covid-19 vaccine. Nevertheless, this reluctance was less prominent than for vaccination in general, reflecting the actual spread of the epidemic in various social milieux. Finally, our analysis showed that trust in the government's actions was significantly associated with reluctance toward the Covid-19 vaccine, even more than toward vaccination in general.           Specific campaigns should be thought beforehand to reach women and people at the bottom of the social hierarchy to avoid furthering social inequalities in terms of morbidity and mortality.},

Les m\'edecins g\'en\'eralistes jouent un r\^ole pivot dans la vaccination de la population en France. La quasi-totalit\'e des m\'edecins interrog\'es dans le cadre du panel de m\'edecins g\'en\'eralistes de ville sont favorables \`a la vaccination en g\'en\'eral, et la tr\`es grande majorit\'e font confiance aux sources officielles (autorit\'es et agences sanitaires). Cependant, un tiers d'entre eux pr\'ef\`erent se fier \`a leur propre jugement, et les m\'edecins ne se sentent pas toujours en confiance pour informer leurs patients sur certains aspects des vaccins, comme les adjuvants. Au total, pr\`es d'un quart d'entre eux \'emettent des doutes \`a l'\'egard des risques et de l'utilit\'e de certains vaccins. Ce scepticisme, cons\'equence notamment des r\'ecentes controverses sur les vaccins comme celle li\'ee \`a la pand\'emie A/H1N1, est susceptible de contribuer \`a l'insuffisance de certaines couvertures vaccinales en France. L'enqu\^ete montre ainsi que le fait d'exprimer des doutes \`a l'\'egard des vaccins est associ\'e \`a des comportements de recommandations de diff\'erents vaccins moins r\'eguliers.},
